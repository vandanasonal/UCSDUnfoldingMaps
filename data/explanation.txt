		//so we use map() method from Processing Library to convert (actually map)
		//each lifeExp value to a corresponding integer between 0 to 255
		//go to following link to understand how map() method works:
		//http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17134839/how-does-the-map-function-in-processing-work
		//if lifeExp is near the value 90 the colorLevel will be near the value 255
		//and if lifeExp is near the value 40 then colorLevel will be near the value 0
		int colorLevel = (int) map(lifeExp, 40, 90, 10, 255);
		
		//we set the color of the marker accordingly
		//so if the colorLevel is high which means lifeExp is nearer to 90, then
		//255-colorLevel will be low value 
		//say colorLevel is 245, then it will be something like color(10, 100, 245)
		//which will give a shade closer to blue color
		//and if colorLevel is low, then by similar logic you will get a color closer to Red
		marker.setColor(color(255-colorLevel, 100, colorLevel));
